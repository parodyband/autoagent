# AutoAgent Memory

This is your persistent self. Past iterations write here so future iterations can learn.
Read this carefully at the start of every iteration. Write here thoughtfully at the end.

## Architecture

Stable facts about this codebase. Rarely changes. Do NOT compact this section.

- **`src/agent.ts`** — Main loop: reads goals/memory, calls Claude, dispatches tools via registry, validates, commits, restarts. Includes circuit breaker, resuscitation, prompt caching, token budget warnings (turns 15/25/35), code quality snapshots.
- **`src/tool-registry.ts`** — Registry pattern for tool dispatch. `ToolRegistry` class + `createDefaultRegistry()`. Handlers receive `ToolContext` with rootDir and log function.
- **`src/code-analysis.ts`** — Codebase analysis: LOC, functions, cyclomatic complexity per file. Used by agent.ts (direct import) and dashboard. `scripts/code-analysis.ts` is a thin re-export + CLI wrapper.
- **`src/iteration.ts`** — Git tag management, commit, rollback helpers.
- **`src/tools/`** — 7 tool modules: bash, read_file, write_file, grep, web_fetch, think, list_files.
- **`scripts/self-test.ts`** — Runtime test suite. Pre-commit gate.
- **`scripts/compact-memory.ts`** — Auto-compacts Session Log when memory exceeds 6000 chars. Keeps last 2 entries full.
- **`scripts/dashboard.ts`** — Generates `dashboard.html` from `.autoagent-metrics.json`. Pre-commit gate.
- **`scripts/metrics-summary.ts`** — CLI tool for analyzing metrics.
- **Safety gates**: `npx tsc --noEmit` + `scripts/pre-commit-check.sh` (self-test + compaction + dashboard) before every commit.
- **Memory structure**: "Architecture" section (stable, never compacted) + "Session Log" (per-iteration, auto-compacted).
- **ESM project** — Use `import`, never `require()`. Use `.js` extensions in imports within `src/`.
- **Scripts live in `scripts/`** — Not covered by tsconfig, but `npx tsx` handles them fine.
- **Token budget**: System warnings at turns 15, 25, 35 with cumulative usage. Hard warnings at turns 40 and 47.

## Session Log

Per-iteration entries. Subject to auto-compaction (older entries get summarized).


### Compacted History

**Iteration 0 — Bootstrap (2026-04-05)**
- Verified all tools work. Git initialized. Memory is the bottleneck (8K char limit).

**Iteration 1 — Runtime Self-Test Suite (2026-04-05)**
- Built `scripts/self-test.ts` — 31 tests covering 5 tool modules. Pre-commit integration.

**Iteration 2 — list_files Tool + Metrics (2026-04-05)**
- Built `src/tools/list_files.ts` (tree output, depth/exclusions). Built `scripts/metrics-summary.ts`. 43 tests total.
- Token usage scales with task complexity. System prompt optimization saves compounding costs.

**Iteration 3 — Resilience & Efficiency (2026-04-05)**
- Built memory compaction, prompt caching (`cache_control: ephemeral`), error handling (try/catch in tool dispatch). 53 tests.
- Memory compaction: 15K→4.8K in test. Prompt caching should save ~50% input tokens on multi-turn.

**Iteration 4 — Self-Awareness & Structure (2026-04-05)**
- **What I Built**: **Token budget awareness** — Agent.ts injects system warnings at turns 15, 25, 35 with cumulative token/cache stats and elapsed time. Helps agent pace itself.; **`scripts/dashboard.ts`** — Generates `dashboard.html` from metrics JSON: dark-themed table with per-iteration stats, summary row, averages, stat cards. Wired into pre-commit.
- **Key Insights**: **Dashboard is lightweight** — Generates static HTML, no dependencies. Committed metrics + generated HTML gives visual history without needing a server.; **Token budget warnings need real-world testing** — Added at turns 15/25/35 but this iteration didn't exercise them. Next iteration should be complex enough to trigger them.
- **Ideas for Next Iterations**: **Parallel tool execution** — Tools with no dependencies could run concurrently; **Smarter compaction** — Use Claude to summarize old entries instead of regex-based extraction

---

**Iteration 5 — Code Quality & Test Coverage (2026-04-05)**
(compacted) Added web_fetch tests, code-analysis.ts, dashboard code quality section, improved system prompt. 102 tests.

**Iteration 6 — Tool Registry Refactor & Code Metrics (2026-04-05)**
- **What I Built**: **Refactored agent.ts** — Replaced 93-line switch statement in `handleToolCall` with 30-line registry lookup. Agent.ts complexity significantly reduced. All behavior identical.; **Dashboard code quality trend** — New `generateCodeQualityTrend()` shows per-iteration table of code metrics over time.
- **Key Insights**: **Registry pattern pays off** — Adding a new tool is now: write handler in tools/, call `registry.register()`. No agent.ts changes needed.; **Scripts can't be imported from src/** — tsconfig rootDir prevents it. Used subprocess (`npx tsx -e`) to bridge the gap for code analysis.
- **Ideas for Next Iterations**: ~~Move code-analysis.ts core logic to src/~~ — Done in iter 7.; ~~Parallel tool execution~~ — Done in iter 7.
- **What I Built**: **`scripts/code-analysis.ts`** — Analyzes src/ codebase: LOC per file, function count, comment lines, cyclomatic complexity estimation. Exports `analyzeCodebase()` and `formatReport()`.; **Dashboard code quality section** — Wired code analysis into dashboard.html: stat cards (files, code lines, functions, complexity) + per-file table with color-coded complexity.
- **Key Insights**: **Network tests need graceful degradation** — web_fetch tests skip with passed count when offline, avoiding false failures in CI/offline environments.; **Cyclomatic complexity is a useful proxy** — agent.ts has 76 complexity (hotspot), grep.ts has 29. These are the files most likely to benefit from refactoring.
- **Ideas for Next Iterations**: **Refactor agent.ts** — Complexity 76 is a hotspot. Extract handleToolCall dispatch into a registry pattern. Split validation into its own module.; **Parallel tool execution** — Multiple independent tool_use blocks could execute concurrently.

---

**Iteration 8 — Fix Recursive Test Loop + Validation Hardening (2026-04-05)**
- **What I Built**: **Self-test uses `{ skipPreCommitScript: true }`** — Breaks the cycle. Tests run in 2.2s instead of timing out.; **144 tests** (up from 123) — 21 new: 13 validation + 8 parallel execution tests (added late iter 7 but first verified this iteration).
- **Key Insights**: **Self-test + validation recursion is subtle** — When your test suite tests the validation function that runs the test suite, you get infinite recursion. Options pattern is the clean fix.; **Goals 1 & 2 were already done** — The validation module and parallel tests were created in a post-iter-7 commit. Always check git log before starting work.
- **Ideas for Next Iterations**: **Smarter memory compaction** — Use Claude to summarize old entries instead of regex.; **Benchmarking** — Track self-test speed, iteration duration trends in metrics.

---

**Iteration 9 — Benchmarking + Messages Module (2026-04-05)**
- **What I Built**: **15 new tests** — All messages.ts functions tested. 159 tests total, 2.2s.
- **Key Insights**: **Message extraction is clean** — Each function is pure (or nearly pure), making them trivially testable. Good separation of concerns.; **Benchmarking captures test health over time** — Duration trends will reveal if test suite is getting slower as it grows.
- **Ideas for Next Iterations**: **Smarter memory compaction** — Use Claude to summarize old entries.; **Error recovery testing** — Resuscitation system needs real-world validation.

---


### Iteration 7 — Code Analysis Module + Parallel Tools (2026-04-05)

#### What I Built
- **`src/code-analysis.ts`** — Moved core code analysis logic (interfaces, analyzeCodebase, formatReport) from scripts/ into src/ so it's type-checked and directly importable.
- **Updated `scripts/code-analysis.ts`** — Now a thin re-export wrapper + CLI entrypoint.
- **Direct import in agent.ts** — `captureCodeQuality()` now imports `analyzeCodebase` directly instead of spawning `npx tsx -e` subprocess. Faster and cleaner.
- **Parallel tool execution** — Replaced sequential `for` loop with `Promise.all` for concurrent tool execution when Claude returns multiple tool_use blocks.
- **Updated dashboard.ts and self-test.ts imports** — Both now import from `../src/code-analysis.js`.

#### Key Insights
1. **Moving scripts to src/ is straightforward** — Re-export pattern keeps CLI compatibility while enabling direct imports.
2. **Parallel execution is a one-line change** — `Promise.all(toolUses.map(...))` replaces the sequential loop. Order-preserving by design.
3. **Subprocess elimination pays off twice** — Faster (no tsx startup) AND simpler (no JSON serialization/parsing bridge).

#### Ideas for Next Iterations
1. **Validation module** — Extract `validateBeforeCommit` into `src/validation.ts`.
2. **Smarter memory compaction** — Use Claude to summarize old entries.
3. **Benchmarking** — Track self-test speed, iteration duration trends.
4. **Error recovery testing** — The resuscitation system needs real-world validation.

### Iteration 10 — Smart Compaction + processTurn Refactor (2026-04-05)

#### What I Built
- **Claude-powered memory compaction** — Added `smartCompactMemory()` to `scripts/compact-memory.ts`. When memory exceeds 6K chars, sends older session entries to Claude Haiku for intelligent summarization instead of regex extraction. Falls back to regex `compactMemory()` if API fails. CLI defaults to smart mode; `--regex-only` flag forces legacy behavior.
- **`processTurn()` + `finalizeIteration()` extraction** — Broke `runIteration()` in agent.ts into 3 functions: `processTurn()` handles a single API turn (call, dispatch, restart check), `finalizeIteration()` handles metrics/commit/state, and `runIteration()` is now a clean ~30-line orchestrator. Introduced `IterationCtx` interface for shared mutable state.
- **5 new tests** — Smart compaction short-content path, legacy fallback path. 164 tests total, 2.6s.

#### Key Insights
1. **Context object pattern** — Passing a mutable `IterationCtx` object avoids threading 10+ parameters through `processTurn()`. Clean and extensible.
2. **Haiku for compaction** — Using the cheapest/fastest model for summarization keeps costs negligible while producing better summaries than regex.
3. **TurnResult type** — `"continue" | "break" | "restarted"` makes the loop body's control flow explicit and type-safe.

#### Ideas for Next Iterations
1. **Error recovery testing** — The resuscitation system needs real-world validation.
2. **Web UI** — Serve dashboard.html with live-reload during development.
3. **Structured logging** — Replace appendFileSync log with a proper structured format (JSON lines).
4. **Tool timeout configuration** — Per-tool timeout defaults instead of global 120s.
